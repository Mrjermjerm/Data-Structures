# Stacks

A stack can be thought of like a stack of plates or pancakes. Just as you place one plate on top of another, you can push items (such as variables or functions) onto a stack. The key idea is that the last item placed on the stack is the first one to be removed. This is known as the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.

Stacks allow us to backtrack or redo. We do this all the time when wrighting a word document. You can give a try by pressing ( crl + z ). 

```csharp
int x = 3;


```
