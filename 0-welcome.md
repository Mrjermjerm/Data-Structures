# Data Structures Tutorial
Welcome to Data Structures. We use Data Structures to organize and store data so that it can be accessed and manipulated efficiently. They define how data is arranged in a computer's memory and how operations like insertion, deletion, search, and update are performed on that data.

- [Linked_List](2-linked_list.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
